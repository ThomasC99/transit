The goal of this game is to get from one place to another within a transit system.

You will spawn at a random station, and your goal is to get to another random station in the same map. Some maps will only cover a single system and others will cover an amalgamation of several. You will get point upon arriving at your destination. You can use point to unlock other maps.
