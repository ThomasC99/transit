The goal of this game is to get from one place to another within a transit system.

You will spawn at a random station, and your goal is to get to another random station in the same map. Some maps will only cover a single system and others will cover an amalgamation of several. You will get point upon arriving at your destination. You can use point to unlock other maps.



# Summary of Maps

## Ottawa
Ottawa has a realtively new transit system that started with a total of five stations in 2012 but has increased rapidly in size with a new line of 13 stations oppening in 2019. When the current construction plans are completed in 2025 (don't quote me on that), the system will have a total of 41 stations and 4 lines.
